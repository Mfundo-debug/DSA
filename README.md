Data Structures Algorithms in python
Data structures and algorithms are fundamental concepts in computer science that are essential for designing efficient and effective software. 
They provide a way to organize and manipulate data in a way that allows for efficient access, insertion, and deletion of elements. 
Understanding these concepts and being able to apply them to solve problems is a key skill for any computer scientist or software developer.
